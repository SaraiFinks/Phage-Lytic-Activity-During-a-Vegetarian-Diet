#Phage Lytic Activity During a Vegetarian Diet 

Bacteriophages and nutrient intake are central to modulating bacterial communities, but their combined impacts on gut microbiome variation are poorly understood. Here we characterize the diversity, abundance, and composition of enriched phage particles before, during, and after a short-term, vegetarian diet intervention to test the new hypothesis that diet modulates gut phage communities in an individualized manner. Phage activity of both newly induced and persistent phages was most pronounced during the vegetarian diet. Induced phages arose from a higher number of bacterial host taxa than persistent phages during the diet, and phage production was broadly active across diverse members of the bacterial community. Consequently, the composition of the phage community diverged across the diet intervention, suggesting a high degree of turnover within a relatively short period. Taken together, a switch from an omnivore to a vegetarian diet linked with enhanced lytic phage activity in a highly individualized manner. The study of dietary modulation of the gut microbiome requires an underappreciated virome dimension.
