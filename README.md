Phage Lytic Activity During a Vegetarian Diet 

Bacteriophages and nutrient intake are central to modulating gut bacterial communities, but their combined impacts on microbiomes across different gut environmental contexts are poorly understood. Here we evaluate the hypothesis that diet modulates the gut phage communities during a short-term, vegetarian diet intervention, and characterize the diversity, abundance, and composition of enriched phage particles before, during, and after the intervention. We find that phage activity was most pronounced during the vegetarian diet, occurring in a highly individualized manner. Indeed, a greater number of predicted bacterial host genera for induced relative to persistent phages was observed, supporting phage production occurring across diverse  members of the bacterial community, which also varied significantly across study participants. Notably, the phage community patterns became more divergent across the diet intervention, highlighting their rapid response to the diet shift. Taken together, the shift from omnivore to a vegetarian diet links with a burst in lytic phage activity in highly individualized manners. Consequently, understanding diet-induced, microbiome changes may require an underappreciated virome dimension.
